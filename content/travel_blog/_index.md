This section contains blogs written during our trips to Senegal. We started this initiative in 2025, mainly because weâ€™re terrible at taking photos and sharing our work, especially non-technical dissemination.

Developing a project isnâ€™t just about working on the technical aspects; itâ€™s also about properly sharing and communicating its progress. Moreover, this project has a strong social and human component that deserves, at the very least, an attempt to convey it in some way. This corner of the website is our effort to do so. We hope you enjoy it.
