Three months ago we participated in the [IEEE CUNC Challenge](https://ctu.ieee.org/) with our project. The IEEE CUNC Challenge is a global competition that aims to promote the development of innovative solutions to connect the unconnected. The challenge is organized by the IEEE Communications Society and the IEEE Internet Initiative. [The project was selected as one of the three featured projects of the challenge out of 116](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ieee-future-networks_ieeefuturenetworks-connectingtheunconnected-activity-7233330932911337472-LgX7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
