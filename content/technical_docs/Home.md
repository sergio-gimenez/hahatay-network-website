This project is part of the Hahatay Community Network, a cooperation project that started in 2019 with the NGO Hahatay that aims to connect the region of Gandiol, in the rural Senegal. Hahatay is an organization that operates on the basis of the Wolof concept of "Man na nekk," which translates to "it is possible." This concept drives the organization's mission to constantly work towards ensuring that all individuals can live with dignity, being the protagonists of their own lives and the drivers of their own development and freedom. The origin of this concept comes from the founder of Hahatay, Mamadou Dia, who has had a dual migratory experience.
